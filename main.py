# Change the following print statement so that it uses the addition operator + and prints out 8

# Write a print statement that uses the division operator / 

# Add a print statement that uses multiplication *

# Create a variable called `length` and assign a value to it

# Create a variable called    `width` and assign a value to it

# Create a variable called `area` and assign to it the multiplication of `length` and `width`

# Print `area` in the following: "The result is " followed by the `area` variable


# BONUS: Print the area in the following syntax: "If the length of a rectangle is 5, and width is 3 then the area is: 15". Keep in mind that you should replace the numbers with their respective variables.
